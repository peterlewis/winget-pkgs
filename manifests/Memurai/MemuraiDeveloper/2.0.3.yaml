Description: "Memurai is a Redis-5-compatible cache and data store for Windows. It is designed to provide the reliability and performance demanded by enterprise Windows environments.Just like Redis, Memurai uses an in-memory data set to achieve great performance at scale, and Memurai supports all the Redis features that you know and love, such as persistence, replication, transactions, LUA scripting, high-availability, pub/sub, cluster, modules, streams, and LRU eviction. In fact, it supports all of the Redis API 5 eviction policies."
